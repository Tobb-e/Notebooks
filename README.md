# Stable Diffusion v1.5/2.0/2.1 on Colab

### How-to use any custom model with Stable Diffusion

1. Upload the model(s) to any folder on your Google Drive storage. Remember that you only got 15GB of space on a free account so don't go crasy and upload a bunch
2. Completely finish loading the Notebook file 'SD_Colab_ Edition_All_Versions.ipynb'
3. You will now find new folders and files in your Google Drive. Move any model(s) you want to use to the directory sd/stable-diffusion-webui/models/Stable-diffusionand
4. Hit the refresh button in the top left corner inside the WebUI. It will take some time until they show up the first time you run the Notebook
5. Select the model you want to use and have fun

I will list a few good models (In my opinion) with links to get you started
